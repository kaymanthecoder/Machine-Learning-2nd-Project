# Machine-Learning-2nd-Project

This is an Logistic Regression using Python Machine Learning. 

The aim of Logistic regression is to model the probabilities of a response variable as a function of some explanatory variables.
To perform descriptive discriminative analysis such as describing the difference between individuals in separate groups as a function of explanatory variables. 
To predict probabilities that individuals fall into two categories of the binary response as a function of some explanatory variables. 
And to classify individuals into two categories based on explanatory variables. 

The diabetes dataset comes with Sklearn, consists of 10 physiological variables (age, sex, weight and blood pressure) measure on 442 patients, and an indication of the disease progression after one year. The goal is to predict disease progression from physiological variables.

This graph shows that the higher the age of a patient the more accurate the test results was.
